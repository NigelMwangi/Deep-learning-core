# Deep-learning-core

Welcome to the Deep Learning Core repository — a curated collection of fundamental and advanced implementations in Deep Learning. This project brings together clean, well-documented code samples that demonstrate the core architectures involving deep learning.

### What's Inside
This repository includes Python-based code examples (using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) covering:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – for image recognition and feature extraction

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – for sequential data like text or time-series

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) – a powerful RNN variant for handling long-term dependencies

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) – basic feedforward networks for classification/regression

- Recursive CNNs – for tasks like hierarchical data processing or advanced vision tasks

Each section includes commented code, example datasets (where applicable), and training workflows to help you understand the core principles of deep learning models.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/NigelMwangi/Deep-learning-core.git
cd Deep-learning-core

2. Set up your environment (recommended: Conda or venv)

3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
